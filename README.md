# Northcoders News API


Welcome to my back end portfolio project. 
As part of an intensive 13-weeks Nortcoders Bootcamp I have been tasked with building an API for the purpose of accessing application data.

To run my code locally you will need to create environment variables. You will need to create two files in the root directory as follows:

.env.test
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```  
.env.development
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```
